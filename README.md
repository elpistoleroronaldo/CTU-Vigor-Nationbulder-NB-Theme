# CTU-Vigor-Nationbulder-NB-Theme
CTU Nationbuilder NB Theme for VIGOROUS digital activists. 

Other sites are jumping off the curb and that's AWESOME!  

//This is skydiving.

You don't want this theme if the campaign manager or the staff are asleep at the switch.

Two huge pullout drawers on website that give vigorous digital activists the tools they need.
So they can do an effective SM job for you TODAY, they see
  -Links to several meme-makers
  -Trending hashtag list
  -What's hot on Facebook and YOUR Faceboook page
  -Link to answer incoming emails
  -Link to pick up voice mail
  -Big video training section (most videos shorter than 2-3 minutes)
  
  Guides self-enrolled digital activists into being more productive 
  and more effective.  Counts Tweet; counts FB posts.
  Reminds activists where their activity is low.
  
// spaces or tabs?  WE DON'T CARE.  

Effectiveness in campaign ops is what we care about.  Contact and we can train, too.

If you are being pestered all the time by people who want to 'do social media' for your campaign,
then this is the theme to install.

You don't need this theme if...

  - you don't realize that replies to your mass emails are undeliverable
  - you think that your staff will take care of it without instructions
  - you have digital vendors who talk a great game in staff meetings
  - you don't realize that your digital op is *always* in trouble
